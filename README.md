```

### Bot Permissions

Your bot needs these permissions in Discord:

**Essential Permissions:**

- Read Message History

**Moderation Permissions:**
- Manage Messages (for `/clear` and auto-moderation)

```

Replace `YOUR_BOT_CLIENT_ID` with your bot's client ID from the Discord Developer Portal.
